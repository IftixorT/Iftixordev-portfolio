      `Iâ€™ve developed a lot of apps and websites since I was 13 years old. At the time, I didnâ€™t know what a full stack meant because the term wasnâ€™t developed at the time.
      After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a great idea to use bootstrap so I don't have to style everything independently, and I learned how to create interactive websites by learning the JavaScript programming language, and for obvious reasons, if you know bootstrap, great.`,
      `I can independently React, Svelte, Node.js, Express.js, Fastify, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind-css,
      Sass, jQuery, React Hooks, Axios, Redux, Redux-saga, NPM, Yarn, Postman, Figma, Restful Api, Json, Trello, Jira, Git, GitHub, Next.js, Firebase, AWS, Netlify.`,
      `I learned algorithms and data structures by coding from the following websites and so far I am learning LeetCode, algoexpert, hackerrank.com.`,
